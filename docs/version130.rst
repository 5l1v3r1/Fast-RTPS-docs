Version 1.3.0
=============

With the new 1.3.0 version of eProsima Fast RTPS come new features:

* Unbound message size support: By the addition of a dynamic memory management mode, you can now send variable size data without needing to specify a limit. This will allow you to easily introduce video feeds into your network while keeping the Fast RTPS memory footprint at check.
* Improved network behaviour: Choose exactly how to fragment your data and the transfer rate to have precise control over your network traffic in low bandwidth situations.

As always, we strive to provide a top notch user experience:

* Revamped logging system: Get even more introspection about the status of your communications system.
* Static Discovery: Use XML to map your network and keep discovery traffic to a minimum.
* Stability and performance improvements: A new iteration of our built-in performance tests will make benchmarking easier for you.
